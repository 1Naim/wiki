# Provide Logs

CachyOS does provide a great tool to gather logs, called `cachyos-bugreport.sh`.
This tool will collect logs from:
- dmesg
- journlctl

When the logs are collected, it will ask the user, if this should be uploaded to our paste services.

You simply run:
`sudo cachyos-bugreport.sh` in the terminal and then post the link with the bugs into the topic.
