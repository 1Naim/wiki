CachyOS does provide several ways to install the system.
The "Erase Disk" Option in Calamares will wipe the selected disk and install then CachyOS to the target.

1. Boot into the ISO and click the Launch Installaer Button
2. Choose between the Bootloader you want to use, also see the Bootloader Wiki Entry
3. Choose your Region
4. Choose your Keyboard Layout
5. Choose your filesystem, also see Filesystem Entry
6. Choose your Desktop Environment you want to use, see Desktop Enviroments
7. Tick or Untick further packages for the netinstallation.
8. Check the Summary Page and proceed with the installation.

The System will then install CachyOS to your system. The Drivers will be fully configured out of the box with our Hardware Detection. There is no need to install further drivers or equal after the installation.

As soon the system is installed, you get a prompt to reboot your system.
