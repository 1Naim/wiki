# Installation
## General Information's

CachyOS does provide out of the box T2 MacBook support and the required kernel patches are shipped in the default kernel.

The WiFi Support is currently not implemented, since this is a closed source firmware, which we are not allowed to distribute.
The Installation will only work with LAN Internet connection, after the installation you can download on your own the firmware and install it to have proper WiFi Support.

You will find below a way to install the firmware after the installation.

## Proceeding with Installation

In the Wiki you can find how to flash and download the ISO.

After flashing the ISO Image just follow the On Root installation Page.
CachyOS does automatically configure your system with the CachyOS Hardware Detection, which does apply required boot parameters and other configuration.

## Installation of the Firmware

The firmware can be downloaded and fetched from another mirror, which hosts it from the T2 Wiki.

Run the following commands, after you have booted into the Installed System:
